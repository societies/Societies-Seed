To use XMPP connection, you need:
* to enable "BOSH Clients With Limited Access to Connect to the Server" in the Openfire Administration 
(Server > Server Parameters > HTTP Binding)
The HTTP-BINDING address is by default: http://localhost:7070/http-bind.

* to configure your Apache to use http://localhost/bosh (or whatever you wanted) instead http://localhost:7070/http-bind.
Example of Apache configuration (somewhere in Apache httpd.conf for example)

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ProxyPass /bosh http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
        ProxyPassReverse /bosh http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
    </VirtualHost>

* to edit the js/shared.js file 
The BOSH_SERVICE variable must contain your XMPP server HTPP-BIND URL.
In the example above, it was "http://localhost/bosh" on your computer, and "http://<IP of your computer>/bosh" on an Android emulator

Notice: if you don't have an XMPP server available, you can try this app with mock data. In shared.js edit MOCK_MODE to true
to emulate XEP SOC1, and even MOCK_CONNECTION_MODE to true to emulate XMPP connection.
