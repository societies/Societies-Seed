Required Configurations To Use CameraApp
-------
To use XMPP connection, you need:
* to enable "BOSH Clients With Limited Access to Connect to the Server" in the Openfire Administration 
(Server > Server Parameters > HTTP Binding)
The HTTP-BINDING address is by default: http://localhost:7070/http-bind.

* to configure your Apache to use http://localhost/bosh (or whatever you wanted) instead of http://localhost:7070/http-bind.
Example of Apache configuration :
** First, enable proxy module. Delete the # before the following lines in httpd.conf, or add these lines

    LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
    LoadModule proxy_connect_module modules/mod_proxy_connect.so
    LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
    Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

** Then, add the virtual host somewhere in Apache httpd.conf for example:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ProxyPass /bosh http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
        ProxyPassReverse /bosh http://localhost:7070/http-bind/
    </VirtualHost>
    
** If everything is ok, when you go on http://localhost/bosh or http://localhost:7070/http-bind/, you should see something like:

    HTTP ERROR 400

    Problem accessing /http-bind/. Reason:

        Bad Request
    
* to edit the js/shared.js file 
The `BOSH_SERVICE` variable must contain your XMPP server HTPP-BIND URL.
In the example above, it was "http://localhost/bosh" on your computer, and "http://<IP of your computer>/bosh" on an Android emulator.

How Can I Found My IP Address?
-------
* On Windows, open a console and tip "ipconfig"


Notice: Mock Mode
-------
If you don't have an XMPP server available, you can try this app with mock data. In shared.js edit MOCK_MODE to true
to emulate XEP SOC1, and even MOCK_CONNECTION_MODE to true to emulate XMPP connection.
