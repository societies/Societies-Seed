Initial code to try out a Whack based external component and a Smack based client talking to each other.
Note that, besides a running Openfire client, you'll need to have:
- an external component shared secret of redman
- a user called red with password red
- your system must be able to resolve socialblend.local to the Openfire server

Oh and, this should work with non-openfire, if someone could give it a shot


Step-by-step instructions to get it running:
============================================
Prerequisites:
- Install Openfire (That's what I've tried it with).
- Go here http://localhost:9090/external-components-settings.jsp (or change server location, of course)
- Ensure that you enabled External Components (the server ought to listen on port 5275).
- Ensure the shared secret between XC and server is "redman" or change the XC code to whatever you want

And now, with Openfire running, Just do this:
- In eclipse, with all checked out, right click on the pom in Builder and run as maven package 

- Right click on FortuneCookieXC and run as java application (Main class' called Main)
- Same for FortuneCookieClient. Main class' FortuneCookieClient

You should see output from both processes
