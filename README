Initial code to try out a Whack based external component and a Smack based client talking to each other.
Note that, besides a running Openfire client, you'll need to have:
- an external component shared secret of redman
- a user called red with password red
- your system must be able to resolve socialblend.local to the Openfire server

Oh and, this should work with non-openfire, if someone could give it a shot
